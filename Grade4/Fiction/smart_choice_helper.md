The Smart Choice Helper

Tommy sat at his desk, staring at his computer screen while his fingers tapped nervously against the keyboard. 
Last week, something happened that made him realize how tough it can be to make good decisions, especially when adults aren't always honest. 
That experience gave him an idea for the school's coding competition, and now he was determined to turn it into reality.

It all started when Tommy went to check out the new gym near his house. 
The person at the front desk tried to make him sign up for a yearly membership, even though Tommy clearly explained he was only twelve and his parents weren't with him. 
The gym worker kept pushing, saying it was a "special one-day deal" that Tommy would "regret missing out on." 
Something felt wrong about the whole situation, and Tommy left feeling confused and upset. 
Why would an adult try to pressure a kid into something like that?

That night, while doing his homework, Tommy thought about how many other kids might face similar situations. 
What if there was a way to help people, especially young people, figure out if they were being pressured into bad decisions? 
He remembered what his computer science teacher said about artificial intelligence - how it could be programmed to analyze situations based on rules and patterns. 
Suddenly, Tommy had his big idea: an app called "Smart Choice Helper" that would ask users questions about their situation and help them think it through.

Over the next two weeks, Tommy worked hard on his app. 
He programmed it to ask important questions like "Are you feeling rushed to make a decision?" and "Have you talked to someone you trust about this?" 
The app would then analyze the answers and give helpful advice about whether to slow down, talk to a trusted adult, or look for more information. 
When he finally presented it at the coding competition, Tommy didn't just win first place - he created something that could actually help other kids avoid the 
kind of situation he faced. His teacher was so impressed that she helped him share it with other schools, and now kids everywhere use Smart Choice Helper when they're not sure about a decision.
