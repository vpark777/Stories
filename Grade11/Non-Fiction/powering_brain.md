# Powering the Brain: How Food, Movement, and Mitochondria Impact Energy and Focus

Inside almost every cell in your body are microscopic structures called mitochondria. Often described as the “powerhouses” of the cell, 
mitochondria are responsible for producing adenosine triphosphate (ATP)—the molecule that stores and transports chemical energy. 
Your brain, which uses up about 20% of your body’s energy, relies heavily on efficient mitochondrial function to help you concentrate, 
regulate emotions, and process information.

The food you eat plays a major role in how well your mitochondria function. Whole foods like leafy greens, fruits, fish, legumes, and nuts 
contain essential micronutrients—including magnesium, iron, and coenzyme Q10—that mitochondria need for energy production. 
These foods also contain antioxidants, which protect mitochondria from oxidative stress, a process that can damage cells when too many free radicals are present.

One major threat to mitochondrial health is the regular consumption of ultra-processed foods. These are foods that have been heavily modified with 
industrial ingredients like artificial flavorings, preservatives, hydrogenated oils, and emulsifiers. 
Examples include soda, chips, candy, fast food, sugary cereals, and many packaged snacks. 
While convenient, ultra-processed foods often lack the nutrients mitochondria need and may promote systemic inflammation, which interferes with mitochondrial energy production and cellular repair.

A particularly important nutrient for mitochondrial health is vitamin B12. This vitamin supports the metabolism of every cell in the body, especially 
in making DNA and keeping nerve cells healthy. It plays a direct role in the citric acid cycle, which is the core process mitochondria use to turn nutrients into ATP. 
B12 is found primarily in animal-based foods like meat, eggs, and dairy, so individuals who eat mostly plant-based diets may need to take supplements or consume fortified foods to meet their needs.

Some individuals have a condition known as pernicious anemia, in which their bodies can’t absorb vitamin B12 properly. This is often due to a lack of intrinsic factor, 
a protein made in the stomach that is essential for B12 absorption in the small intestine. Even if someone eats enough B12, they can still develop a deficiency if 
intrinsic factor is missing. Symptoms may include fatigue, poor memory, and tingling in the hands and feet—all signs that the nervous system isn’t getting the energy it needs.

In addition to proper nutrition, physical activity is one of the most effective ways to support and even increase mitochondrial function. 
Aerobic exercises like running, swimming, or biking activate signals in the body that trigger mitochondrial biogenesis, the creation of new mitochondria. 
Exercise also increases oxygen delivery to the brain and muscles, which further enhances energy production and cognitive performance. 
Over time, regular movement strengthens the body’s ability to handle physical and mental challenges.

Mitochondria are also highly sensitive to sleep and stress. During sleep, especially deep non-REM sleep, the body enters a restorative state that allows mitochondria to repair 
themselves and remove damaged components. Chronic stress, on the other hand, increases the production of cortisol and other stress hormones that can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction 
if not balanced with recovery. Mindful activities like meditation, breathing exercises, and nature walks can help regulate the body’s stress response and protect mitochondrial health.

In conclusion, mitochondria are not just abstract biology concepts—they directly impact how we feel, think, and function every day. 
A lifestyle that supports mitochondrial health through nutrient-dense food, regular movement, adequate sleep, and stress management can lead to better focus, 
more stable energy, and improved long-term brain performance. Understanding and supporting these tiny powerhouses may be one of the most effective ways to boost both physical and mental well-being.
