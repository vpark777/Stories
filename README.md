# Stories
## Stories by grade levels

My goal is to create and share a collection of stories for students in grades 4–12, categorized by Non-Fiction and Fiction.

I’m intentionally starting at grade 4 because there’s already a wealth of materials for younger children focused on phonics and foundational reading skills. But as kids get older, many who struggle with reading comprehension fall further and further behind, not just in reading, but in general knowledge, which limits their ability to engage with peers and the world around them.

I’m not a reading expert, but I’ve read the work of those who are. And I believe this:

	We don’t have to be perfect to be helpful.

To address that, I’m starting with non-fiction passages by grade level, written in accessible, engaging ways. These passages will cover important topics like:<br>
- How the U.S. government works 
- Basic scientific principles
- Global cultures and geography
- Human psychology and behavior
- Climate change and the environment
- Media literacy and social influence
- Ethics, power, and decision-making

I’ll be using tools like ChatGPT and other large language models to help generate and refine these texts. As of March 24, 2025, LLMs are still not great at writing compelling fiction for kids—but they’re a great starting point for informative and age-appropriate non-fiction.

## Fiction as a Community Project

Once the non-fiction library is underway, I plan to expand into fiction—with help. Writing truly engaging stories for different age levels is an art, and I’d love to make this part of the project collaborative.

Whether you’re an aspiring writer, a teacher, a parent, or a student, your voice matters. This will be an open invitation to co-create meaningful fiction that connects emotionally and intellectually with kids at different ages.

## Sharing & Versioning

To keep everything transparent and open-source, I’ll also share how we organize and version this project using Git. (I have working knowledge from my background as an iOS developer and will create a video to walk beginners through it.)

## What Kids Should Know: A Starting Point
