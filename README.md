Stories by grade levels

My intention is to upload stories by grade level from 4-12 categorized by Non-Fiction and Fiction. I wanted to focus from grade 4 up becausee there is a lot of material out there for younger kids who need foundation in phonics and very rudimentary skills in reading. But beyond the very basics, I've seen a lot of students get further and further behind their peers in reading comprehension. I don't proclaim to be a reading expert but I will share research done by experts.
We don't have to be perfect to be helpful. 

I will start by focusing on Non-Fiction. One of the big issues that I've seen with a lot of children who struggle with reading comprehension is that they end up very behind in general knowledge which hinders their participation with their peers and in society. I will be heavily utilizing ChatGPT and other LLM's to generate passage by grade levels. As of now, 3.24.25, LLMs are not great at generating fiction.

So my intention is to make this a group project enlisting help of aspiring writers of all ages. I will post an ambitious video on how git works. ( I have working knowledge of it as an iOS developer )

Here are some topics I found from speaking with ChatGPT on topics children from grades 4-12 should be familiar with.
